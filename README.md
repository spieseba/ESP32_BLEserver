# ESP32-S3 BLE Server Firmware - example/BLEjoystick

This repository contains firmware for the ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1, implementing a simple Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) server. The repo consists of two branches:
- The main branch advertises a simple counter.
- The example/BLEjoystick branch extends the main branch to read in joystick input and advertise the directional data over BLE.
