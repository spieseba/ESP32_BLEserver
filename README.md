# ESP32-S3 BLE Server Firmware

This repository contains firmware for the ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1, implementing a simple Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) server. The repo consists of two branches:
- The main branch advertises a simple counter.
- The example/BLEjoystick reads in joystick input and advertises it over BLE.
